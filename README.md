# CPSC-3220---Programming-Languages-and-Translation--Project2

Listmania! & Other Stuff
Utilizing Visual Studio Code, Clojure, Calva, & REPL

Instructions:
• Complete all of the following problems.
• Include a complete set of unit tests for your solutions. You must write unit tests for each function that you
are asked to write.
• Do not include error checking (assuming argument types are correct, for example).
• When you are asked to write a function, you may write additional functions that help you simplify the problem.
• Do not use def or defn inside of functions. These define global variables and using them inside a function
indicates a misunderstanding of proper functional programming.
• Except in the “Listmania” section, you may use any of the built-in Clojure functions that you like.
• Submit your solution on Canvas as a single .tar.gz or .zip file containing your entire project folder.
Begin by using lein to create a project called hw2. You must use precisely this project name and place your code
and tests in the correct files for a lein-based project.
